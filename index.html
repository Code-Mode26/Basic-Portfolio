	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img src="http://lorempixel.com/150/150" alt="Derek Frand">

	<p>Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is Lorem Ipsum to manyâ€”it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It's unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be filled with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.</p>

	<p>There's lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old language. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks, wanting to tar and feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.</p>
